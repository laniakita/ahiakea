# Ahiakea: Immense Fish
Just like an immense fish, this is a monorepo full of everything! Well, full of everything we (well, I, currently) have made for Ahiakea, mostly. Why? Well typesharing of course! Typed Schemas from a backend application can get imported right into the front-end and that brings the typescript linter joy, or perhaps it brings me joy, hopefully it does for you as well.
